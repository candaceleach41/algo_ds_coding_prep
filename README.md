# algo_ds_coding_prep
Using this repository to work on coding problems to prep for coding interviews. 

Going to use the README file to add updates to my progress.

From now on, I will be doing easy/medium problems.
  - Possibility once or every other month, plan on doing a hard problem!!!
  - Goal is to solve two coding problems in a 45 minute time limit (looking into starting that in 2 months)
  - Keep in mind, I do have to brush up on algo/ds since it's been a very long time I touched on the subject.
 
Started this journey in 4/1/2021!

Update status 4/8/2021:
  - Making progress with finding patterns and try to solve them.
  - Went from 65 minutes to solving a problem to 80 minutes. (update 4/16/2021)
      - Took a bit longer on some DS problems
  - Solved a lot of easy problems so far, will get to the medium ones soon.
  - Working with another engineer on our though process and thinking out loud. (update 4/16/2021)
  - Some problems I had a hard time with, I did look at the solutions(if I stay stuck for 15 minutes) 
    to get a better understanding.
