# algo_ds_coding_prep
Using this repository to work on coding problems to prep for coding interviews. 

Going to use the README file to add updates to my progress.

From now on, I will be doing easy/medium problems.
  - Possibility once or every other month, plan on doing a hard problem!!!
  - Goal is to solve two coding problems in a 45 minute time limit (looking into starting that in 2 months)
  - Keep in mind, I do have to brush up on algo/ds since it's been a very long time I touched on the subject.
 
Started this journey in 4/1/2021!
