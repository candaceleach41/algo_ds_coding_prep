# algo_ds_coding_prep
Using this repository to work on coding problems to prep for coding interviews. 

Going to use the README file to add updates to my progress.

As of 4/1/2021, I will be doing easy problems!
 - Mainly fousing on arrays and string problems and work my way up to the next DS problems.

Alrighty, as of 4/2/2021, next progression will be trees.
