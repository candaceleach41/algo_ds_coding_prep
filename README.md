# algo_ds_coding_prep
Using this repository to store all my coding problems for coding interviews

Going to use the README file to add any updates to my progress.

As of 4/1/2021, I will be doing easy problems!
 - Mainly fousing on arrays and string problems and work my way up to the next DS problems.
