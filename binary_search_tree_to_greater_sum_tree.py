"""
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that
every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys
greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: This question is the same as

Example 1:

                            4
                         /     \
                        1       6
                     /    \    /   \
                    0      2   5    7
                            \        \
                             3        8

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
Example 2:

Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
Example 3:

Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: [3,3,2]
Example 4:

Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [7,9,4,10]
